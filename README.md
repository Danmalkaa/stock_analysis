Scraping stock data and analysts data off Tipranks, Marketbeat and SeekingAlpha sites.
I've tried implementing several different approaches to extract practical insights - 
1. Ranking Tipranks accuracy and marking 'Stocks to Watch'.
2. A more technical approach - understanding the usual stock behavior and momentum during up/down/moderate trends - through price and volume derivatives, masking according to a certain percentile, analyzing and foreseeing whatâ€™s next.
3. Intra-day stock prices correlation - up/down intra-day trends and correlation between the price at a certain hour and the closing price.
4. Tipranks' stock score and stock recommendations.
